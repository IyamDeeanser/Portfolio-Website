            Tragically, Crater lived up to its name during its last flight. Please, a moment of silence for my faithful certification rocket. <br><br>
            I started development of Crater for my Canadian Association of Rocketry Level 1, 2, and 3 certifications. 
            I’ve always wanted to be certified for HPR, not just for access to high explosives, but also to prove myself as an amateur rocketeer. A rocket is possibly the fastest (and thus, coolest) thing that
        anyone can build, and I wanted to experience the full certification experience, from optimizing OpenRocket designs, to building the rocket, to seeing it fly, to searching for it, and to eventually 
        crater it on the prarie fields.</p>

                    <p class="projectcontent">For the level 1 and 2 certification, Crater would fly on an I600 Aerotech motor in a 38mm casing, while for the level 3 certification, a 54mm J800 would be used.
                        This is the equivalent of the TRA L1 and L2 certifications. </p>
                    <p class="projectcontent">As a grand finale, as all of my peers have insisted, Crater will fly on a K1103X and attempt to break the sound barrier. </p>

                    <p class="projectcontent">For the level 3 certification, Crater did not fly the J800, due to the cost and complexity of flying two motors.
                        Instead, the K1103X was chosen for the flight. The ascent was once again perfect, reaching a top speed of 1280km/hr and an apogee of 2.8 kilometers. 
                        Crater's nosecone, fin can, and body assembly endured a crushing 30.8Gs of acceleration without issue, alongside the stresses of Max-Q and the transonic turbulence.

                    <p class="projectcontent">However, due to my inexperience with designing black powder charges for upper atmosphere, the drogue failed to deploy and Crater landed at close to 600km/hr, 
                        shattering the fin can and nosecone. However, the body tubes survived intact and the internal electronics were generally unharmed!
