        <p class="projectcontent"> "The "Unamed Flight Engine" (pronouced "yoo-fee") is a kerosene/liquid oxygen fueled rocket engine that I'm in the process of testing. It's meant to be a testbed for a future
            series of potential rocket engines that will eventually power UBC Rocket's first liquid-fueled rockets.</p>

            <h3 class="largeheading">Design</h3>
                <p class="projectcontent">The engine was designed with a custom calculator that the team wrote. This produced all of the chamber and injector dimensions. 
                    Our philosophy here was to build something simple and easy to put together, and to get it on a test stand as soon as possible.</p>
                <img src="..\assets\img\UFE\calculator.png" class="projectphoto">
                <p class="projectcontent">The injector was designed as a 3-element pintle with an interrupted annulus.</p>

                <p class="projectcontent">I conducted several kinds of analysis on the rocket engine. 
                    I had to made sure that the material and geometries we chose would hold up to the temperatures 
                    and pressures of operation, and that mass would be optimized for hotfire conditions.</p>

                <p class="projectcontent">For example, the pintle analysis showed that the original fuel reservoir in the injector
                    would cause uneven flow. This signature off-center spray pattern was clear across every simulation run up to that point, 
                    with all kinds of different pintle designs. There was something wrong with the kerosene distribution manifold, 
                    and I eventually discovered a flow rate differential that the pressure distribution pocket wasnâ€™t removing, 
                    causing a larger amount of fuel to flow through one side of the annulus.</p>
