        <p class="projectcontent"> "Goblet" is an ethanol/nitrous oxide fueled rocket engine that I'm in the process of designing right now. It's meant to be the first regeneratively cooled flight engine in Canada.
            To achieve this goal, special focus must be taken towards achieving the required performance characteristics for flight. Details in this article will be a little more brief, as this project is still
        under very active development. The name comes from how it looks like a cup with the TVC mount points - hence, "Goblet of Fire".</p>

            <h3 class="largeheading">Design Criteria</h3>
                <p class="projectcontent">Unlike previous engines I've designed, Goblet has to meet extremely strict requirements to be compatible with a flight vehicle of any kind.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight: Minimized. Previous engines range from 25kg to 10kg. Goblet must be an order of magnitude lighter, at around 1-2kg.</li>
                    <li>Performance: 3.5kN of thrust has to be obtained in a 3 inch diameter combustion chamber to meet liftoff TWR.</li>
                    <li>Reliablilty: Despite being lighter and higher thrust than any engine I've ever worked on, it must be capable of multiple firings without damage of any kind.</li>
                </ul>
