        <p class="projectcontent">The DISC-A 01 is the first  operational printer that DI Self Composite Alloys has produced. It is a 3 axis movement system, compatible with metallic
            3D printing, I was contracted to design and build over the course of an 8 month school term. It was an interesting exercise in designing a classical system that would be operating in 
            a relatively extreme environment.

            <h3 class="largeheading">Design Criteria</h3>
                <p class="projectcontent">The DISC-A 01 printer had to be able to operate long-term in a harsh, metal dust filled environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Size: The kinematic system  needed to cover a 400x400mm build area for the intended tests.</li>
                    <li>Compatibility: There are significant forces and wear involved with the printing process.</li>
                    <li>Reliablilty: A repeatable accuracy of 0.05mm had to be achieved.</li>
                    <li>Cost: This was done on a limited budget of 1000$.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="projectcontent">All moving parts and electronics were sealed against the environment or chosen to be compatible. For example, PTFE slides were used instead of ball bearings,
                    and POM nuts instead of ball screws.

                <p class="projectcontent">Dozens of firmware iterations were written, all based on Marlin. The major difficulty was in getting the firmware operational 
                    with a unique dual Y axis and quad Z axis, and creating comaptibility with a system that did not have classical 3D printing elements.
                    A final configuration was written for this custom movement system.
